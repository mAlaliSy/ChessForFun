# ChessForFun
A partially completed chess game for Android

# Info
This is a partially completed Android chess game. Some of the rules are not implemented. The cess engine is implemented using min-max with Alpha-beta prunning.
The chess engine is slow because it represents the board using arrays. A proper and faster implementation will be using Bitboards and bitwise operators (as they can be done quickly in the processor).
